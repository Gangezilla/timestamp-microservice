                <p class="copy">Hi there, this is a little timestamp converter tool that served as practice for me with express, and coding more outside of work. If you type in a date after the URL above in the format of '19.01.2011', '31 January 1992', or a Unix Timestamp such as '495923023' you'll have this returned to you in a number of different formats.<br><br>This would look something like .com/09.08.2005, for example.
                </p>
                <p class="explain"> Currently, this tool will accept spoken dates in the format 'date month year', or '31 January 1992', natural dates as '31.01.1992' and unix timestamps.
