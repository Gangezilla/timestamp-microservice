            <p class="copy">Hi there, this is a little timestamp converter tool that served as practice for me with express, and coding more outside of work. If you type in a date into the URL above in the format of '19.01.2011', '31 January 1992', or a Unix Timestamp such as '495923023' you'll have this returned to you. Yeah, it is pretty cool.
            </p>
            <p class="explain"> Currently, this tool will accept spoken dates in the format 'date month year', or '31 January 1992', natural dates as '31.01.1992' and unix timestamps.
