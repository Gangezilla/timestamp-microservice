# timestamp-microservice

Hi there, this is a little timestamp converter tool that served as practice for me with express, and coding more outside of work. If you type in a date after the URL above in the format of '19.01.2011', '31 January 1992', or a Unix Timestamp such as '495923023' you'll have this returned to you in a number of different formats.<br><br>This would look something like scottgangemi.com/timestamp/09.08.2005, for example. Currently, this tool will accept spoken dates in the format 'date month year', or '31 January 1992', natural dates as '31.01.1992' and unix timestamps.

You can check this out on my website, scottgangemi.com/timestamp.
